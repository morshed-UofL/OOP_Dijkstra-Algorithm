# OOP_Dijkstra-Algorithm
Object Oriented Programming for Dijkstra Algorithm


# Use an object oriented programming language to implement a (directed) network of nodes and edges.
[Q1] Implement a class Node that holds the information for a single node (integer index)
[Q2] Implement a class Edge that holds the information for a single edge (Nodes, edge weight)
[Q3] Inside the Node Class add an attribute that is a List of adjacent edges
[Q4] Implement a class Graph that contains a list of nodes
[Q5] Create a constructors that take in attribute values for your Node and Edge classes
[Q6] Inside the Node Class add an attribute that is a List of adjacent edges
[Q7] Add a print method to your Edge class that prints the weight and two indices of its nodes
[Q8] Implement Djikstraâ€™s algorithm for finding the shortest path (modify your code, add any classes/methods/attributes needed).
